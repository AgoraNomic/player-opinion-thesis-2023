# Appreciations
## To Janet
Janet found this old pull: CFJ3107 that illuminates the meaning of Treat Agora Right Good:

"I would say that the test on whether an act violates the "right good
forever" clause is whether the act is BOTH (a) truly ethically, and
morally repugnant, or against the spirit of nomic as a whole and (b)
something that the actor has maliciously foreseen could lead directly
and immediately to Agora's effective and irrecoverable demise as a
nomic."

## To G./nix
