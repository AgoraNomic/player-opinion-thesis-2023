# Background:
Hi Agora! I'm working on a thesis regarding player opinions, and started "data collection" (if you can call it that) on 2023-02-13. I'm working through discord chats mostly, but I know I should bring it outwards as well to the players outside that fora. Since the discord players are ALSO on this fora, I'd thought I'd bring these questions to you. My plan is to ask one question per week, on an axis of opinion that I brainstormed with information from discord discussion, up for formal replies onto this discussion fora. If you have any suggestions, I'll welcome it.
