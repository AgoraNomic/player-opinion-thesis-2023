# Background:
Hi Agora! I'm working on a thesis regarding player opinions, and started "data collection" (if you can call it that) on 2023-02-13. I'm working through discord chats mostly, but I'm planning to bring this to the a-d fora. My plan is to ask one question per week, on an axis of opinion that I brainstormed with information from discord discussion, up for formal replies onto this discussion fora. If you have any suggestions, I'll welcome it.
